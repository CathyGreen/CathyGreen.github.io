	<h1>My Trip Around the USA on a Segway<br>Segway'n USA<&nbsp>
	documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!</h1> 

<p>	<br> 
	 
	 <h2> August 20, 2012 </h2>
	<&nbsp>
	Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed<br>
	through some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT,<br>
	Last Chance, CO, Truth or Consequences, NM, Why, AZ <br>
	<&nbsp>
	<h2> July 14, 2012</h2>
	I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:<br>
	<blockquote>"Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity."</blockquote>
	I definitely won't be passing any cars.<br>
	<&nbsp>
	<h2>June 2, 2012</h2>
	My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got<br>
	everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,<br>
	I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cellphone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar<br>
	<&nbsp><blockquote>Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said,
	 <br>
	<blockquote>"A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."</blockquote>
