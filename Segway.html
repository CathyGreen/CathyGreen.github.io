        <h2> August 20, 2012 </h2>
        <p> Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
            <br> through some interesting places on the way:
            <ol>
                <li>Walla Walla, </li>
                <li>WA, </li>
                <li>Magic City,</li>
                <li>ID, </li>
                <li>Bountiful,</li>
                <li>UT</li>
                <li>Last Chance,</li>
                <li>CO, </li>
                <li>Truth or Consequences,</li>
                <li>NM,</li>
                <li>Why,
                    <li>AZ </li>
                    <br>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h2> July 14, 2012</h2>
        <p> I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
            <br>
            <blockquote>"Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity."</blockquote>
            I definitely won't be passing any cars.
            <br>

        <h2>June 2, 2012</h2>
        <p> My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got
            <br> everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
            <br> I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
            <ul>
                <li> cellphone, iPod, </li>
                <li>digital camera, </li>
                <li> a protein bar</li>
        </p>
        </ul>
        <p> Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said,
            <br>
            <blockquote>"A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."</blockquote>
